Hiya,

I'm a Platform Engineer and Researcher with a flair for Cloud and Networks technology from a Solutions Architecture and Cyber Security perspective. I have worked across AWS, GCP, and a bit of Azure using automation tools like Terraform, Ansible, Shell Scripting, Python, and Java (a bit of at an Enterprise level), and am often found tinkering with new tech.
